        This object animator is used to rotate the card view around the Y axis.
        The rotation starts from 0 and ends at 180 degrees.
        The animation takes 500 milliseconds to complete.
        The repeatCount is set to 0, meaning the animation will only play once.
        The interpolator is set to accelerate_quad, which means the animation will start slowly and accelerate towards the end.
